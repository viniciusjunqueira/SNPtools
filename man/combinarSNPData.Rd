\title{Combine multiple SNPDataLong objects}
\usage{
combinarSNPData(lista)
}
\arguments{
\item{lista}{A list of \code{SNPDataLong} objects to be combined.}
}
\value{
A single \code{SNPDataLong} object containing the combined genotype matrix, merged map,
and a concatenated path string.
}
\description{
This function merges a list of \code{SNPDataLong} objects, typically representing different SNP panels 
or datasets, into a single unified \code{SNPDataLong} object. It ensures that all genotype matrices
have the same set of SNPs (filling missing SNPs with NA), and merges the marker map information while
removing duplicate SNP entries.
}
\details{
The function performs the following steps internally:
\enumerate{
  \item Computes the union of all SNPs across input objects.
  \item Fills missing SNP columns in each genotype matrix with NA-coded columns.
  \item Combines genotype matrices by rows (individuals).
  \item Merges marker maps, removing duplicates (retaining the first occurrence).
  \item Creates and returns a new \code{SNPDataLong} object with the combined data.
