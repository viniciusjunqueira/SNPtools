# SNPtools

`SNPtools` is an R package designed for manipulation, organization, and analysis of genotypic data, with a strong focus on integration with tools such as **FImpute** and **PLINK**.

It provides robust S4-based data structures for storing genotypes and marker maps, along with functions to combine different genotype panels, summarize data, and prepare files for imputation and selection pipelines.
